# sqlitebrowser
SQLiteBrowser is a graphical tool for viewing and editing SQLite database files. Hereâ€™s a guide on how to use it, along with examples and expected outcomes.

### Installation

If SQLiteBrowser is not already installed on your Kali Linux system, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt install sqlitebrowser
```

### Starting SQLiteBrowser

You can start SQLiteBrowser from the terminal by typing:

```bash
sqlitebrowser
```

Alternatively, you can find it in your applications menu under "Database".

### Using SQLiteBrowser

1. **Open a Database**:
   - Click on "Open Database" and select the SQLite database file you want to work with (e.g., `mydatabase.db`).

2. **Viewing Tables**:
   - Once the database is open, you can view the tables in the left sidebar. Click on a table to see its contents.

3. **Executing SQL Queries**:
   - Go to the "Execute SQL" tab to run SQL queries directly. For example, to select all records from a table named `users`, you can enter:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users;
     ```

   - Click "Play" to execute the query. The results will be displayed in the bottom pane.

4. **Editing Data**:
   - To edit data, select the "Browse Data" tab, choose the table, and you can directly modify cells. After making changes, click the "Write Changes" button.

5. **Creating a New Table**:
   - Go to the "Database Structure" tab, right-click on the database name, and select "Create Table". Define the table name and columns.

### Example Queries

1. **Insert Data**:
   To insert a new record into the `users` table:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');
   ```

   **Outcome**: A new row will be added to the `users` table.

2. **Update Data**:
   To update an existing record:

   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET email = 'john.doe@example.com' WHERE name = 'John Doe';
   ```

   **Outcome**: The email address for John Doe will be updated.

3. **Delete Data**:
   To delete a record:

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM users WHERE name = 'John Doe';
   ```

   **Outcome**: The row for John Doe will be removed from the `users` table.

4. **Create a New Table**:
   To create a new table called `orders`:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE orders (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       user_id INTEGER,
       product TEXT,
       quantity INTEGER
   );
   ```

   **Outcome**: A new empty table named `orders` will be created.

### Conclusion

SQLiteBrowser is a user-friendly tool for managing SQLite databases, allowing you to perform operations like viewing, editing, and executing SQL commands easily. Always ensure you have backups of your database before making significant changes.

### Using SQLiteBrowser on Kali Linux

**SQLiteBrowser** (DB Browser for SQLite) is a visual tool to create, design, and edit SQLite database files. It provides an intuitive interface for interacting with SQLite databases without needing to write SQL commands manually.

#### Installation

If SQLiteBrowser is not already installed on your Kali Linux system, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sqlitebrowser
```

#### Basic Usage

1. **Launching SQLiteBrowser**:
   Open SQLiteBrowser from the application menu or by typing `sqlitebrowser` in the terminal.

2. **Creating a New Database**:
   - Click on **File** > **New Database**.
   - Choose a location and name for your new database file (e.g., `mydatabase.db`).
   - Click **Save**.

3. **Creating a Table**:
   - After creating the database, a dialog will prompt you to create a new table.
   - Define the table name (e.g., `users`), and add columns (e.g., `id`, `name`, `email`).
   - Specify the data types for each column (e.g., INTEGER for `id`, TEXT for `name` and `email`).
   - Click **OK** to create the table.

4. **Inserting Data**:
   - Click on the **Browse Data** tab.
   - Select the table you created (e.g., `users`).
   - Click on **Insert Row** and fill in the data for each column.
   - Click **Write Changes** to save the data.

5. **Executing SQL Queries**:
   - Switch to the **Execute SQL** tab.

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users;
     ```
   - Click **Execute SQL** to run the command. The results will show in the results pane below.

6. **Exporting Data**:
   - To export your database or table, click on **File** > **Export**.
   - You can choose formats like CSV, SQL, or JSON.

#### Example Workflows

1. **Creating and Populating a Table**:
   - Create a `products` table with columns for `id`, `name`, and `price`.
   - Insert a few rows:
     - (1, "Apple", 0.60)
     - (2, "Banana", 0.50)

   **Expected Outcome**:
   After executing `SELECT * FROM products;`, you would see:
   ```
   id | name   | price
   ---------------------
   1  | Apple  | 0.60
   2  | Banana | 0.50
   ```

2. **Querying Data**:
   - If you want to find all products with a price less than $0.55:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM products WHERE price < 0.55;
     ```

   **Expected Outcome**:
   The query would return:
   ```
   id | name   | price
   ---------------------
   2  | Banana | 0.50
   ```

### Conclusion

SQLiteBrowser is an effective tool for managing SQLite databases visually, making it accessible for users who may not be comfortable with command-line SQL. You can create databases, manage tables, insert data, and execute queries with ease. Remember to save your changes regularly and back up your database files.
